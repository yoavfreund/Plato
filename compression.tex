\section{Opportunities in Data Compression}
\label{sec:compression}
As is well known from signal processing, relatively few model classes, such as ARMA models, Fourier and wavelet-based models and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based models capture very well various scenarios. The key function of the raw data administrator is to choose the appropriate {\em model generator} and feed it with the appropriate parameters that will dictate compression, accuracy. The important lesson from signal processing, which we will discuss in Section~\ref{sec:compression}, is that high compression can be achieved with minimal or even no loss of accuracy.
