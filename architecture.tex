\section{Plato: An extensible model-aware database}
\label{sec:architecture}
The proposed Plato database aims to solve the discussed problems by introducing models as first class citizens. This section provides the basic definitions, architecture (Figure~\ref{fig:basic-architecture}) and examples.

We assume that raw sensor data measurements are stored in conventional SQL tables, which we refer to as {\em measurements tables}. Every measurements table contains among others a subset of the spatiotemporal attributes $X$, $Y$, $Z$ and $T$ (representing the three spatial dimensions and the temporal dimension, respectively).

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\begin{example}
Consider a measurements table with schema \texttt{temp\_meas(Sensor, T, Temp)} containing tuple of the form $(s, t, m)$, signifying that temperature sensor $s$ provided at time $t$ the temperature measurement $m$.
Attribute \texttt{Sensor} is a foreign key to another table \texttt{temp\_sensor(ID, X, Y, Installed\_on, $\ldots$)} providing the properties of each sensor, including among others its latitude and longitude.% 
\footnote{The data administrator can decide what is the best schema for the measurements data. For example, instead of a single table carrying all the temperature sensor measurements, the administrator may choose one table for each sensor.
}
\end{example}
\vspace*{0.5cm}

To facilitate easy data analysis, the model administrator can build models on top of the raw sensor data. A model is a mathematical representation of the world that predicts a quantity of interest (e.g., temperature) at every point of the spatiotemporal domain.
In the basic case, a {\em model} is a continuous function $f:\mathcal{\bar{D}}\mapsto \mathcal{Q}$ from a (generally multidimensional) spatiotemporal domain $\mathcal{\bar{D}}$ to $\mathcal{Q}$. The domain $\mathcal{\bar{D}}$ is in general a subspace of the entire four-dimensional spatiotemporal domain. For instance, it can be a sphere of $(x, y, t)$ points around a center $(x_0, y_0, t_0)$, a square of $(x, y)$ points, etc.

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\begin{example}
For instance, a model for temperature can be a function $f:D_{t\_2012\_now}\mapsto Q_{float}$, which given a point in time $t$ between 2012 and now returns a float, corresponding to the \emph{predicted} temperature at time $t$.
\end{example}
\vspace*{0.5cm}

To generate a model, the model administrator can utilize {\em model generators}, which take as input the raw data and potentially external knowledge about the data and return a model. Model generators are designed by domain specialists, who have knowledge of the domain and the underlying physical properties of the sensor data. For instance, weather experts can design a weather model generator. Although some of the model generators will be domain specific (such as the weather example above), other model generators are more general and have a wide applicability to large range of domains. This includes among others an ARMA model generator (which is suitable for readings from sensors measuring natural phenomena, such as temperature), a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) model generator and other model generators proposed in the statistical literature. \reminder{Add reference}. To bootstrap the system and facilitate the quick generation of models for many common use cases, Plato comes preloaded with several such model generators.

A {\em model generator} $g$ has the general form of $g(R;p)$, taking as input a measurements table $R$ and a tuple $p$ of parameter values.

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\begin{example}
For instance, the model generator $arma(R;<Attr_{cont}; Attr_{meas}>)$ takes as input a measurements table $R$ together with the sets $Attr_{cont}$, $Attr_{meas}$ of attributes of $R$ that correspond to the spatiotemporal attributes and measurement attributes of $R$, respectively and creates an ARMA model $f:\mathcal{\bar{D}}\mapsto\mathcal{\bar{Q}}$, where $\mathcal{\bar{D}}$ is the subspace of the spatiotemporal domain defined by attributes $Attr_{cont}$ and $\mathcal{\bar{Q}}$ is the equal to $Q_1 \times Q_2 \ldots \times Q_n$, where $Q_i$ the domain of the $i$-th attribute in $Attr_{meas}$. \reminder{Which additional parameters should we include to the ARMA model generator's signature to make it generally applicable?}
\end{example}  
\vspace*{0.5cm}

Models created through model generators can be used as values in tables. To this end, Plato extends SQL's data types (e.g., string, integer, etc.), with a new {\em model data type} that comes with an associated model signature $\mathcal{\bar{D}}\mapsto \mathcal{Q}$. An attribute of such a type is called a {\em model attribute} and accepts as values models conforming to the corresponding function signature. We will refer to a table that contains at least one model attribute as a {\em model table}. Model tables are defined by SQL view definitions that involve {\em model generator} functions. 

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\begin{example}
\label{xmpl:models-and-definitions}
%A tuple $(s, f)$ of the table \texttt{temp\_models(Sensor, F:t->temp)} means that the function $f$ describes the real world temperatures, which sensor $s$ was observing. The signature \texttt{t -> float} indicates that the functions/values of \texttt{F} input time and output floating points. The table \texttt{temp\_models} is defined by the view definition:
For instance, in order to create a model table, containing sensor IDs and an ARMA model, representing the predicted temperatures for the particular sensor, one can write the following statement:

\begin{verbatim}
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sensor_models AS 
SELECT sensor, arma(G; T; Temp) AS temp_model
FROM temp_meas GROUP BY sensor AS G(T, Temp)
\end{verbatim}

Note that for ease of exposition, we use an extension of SQL that allows the generation of nested relational tables.\footnote{Extending SQL to nested tables has been a well-studied topic in the database management field and recently it is featured in multiple ``Big Data" databases that feature semistructured models. 
}
In particular the GROUP BY operator creates for each sensor appearing the the measurements table \texttt{temp\_meas} a nested table $G$ containing all measurements for the particular sensor. These measurements are given as input to the ARMA model generator to create the corresponding ARMA model.
The resulting model table \texttt{sensor\_models(sensor, temp\_model)} contains tuples of the form $(s, f)$, where $s$ is a sensor and $f$ the corresponding temperature ARMA model.
\end{example}
\vspace*{0.5cm}

A model table may be virtual in the sense that SQL view definitions are virtual, i.e., no actual computation is performed until a query uses them. However, in practice, the administrator is motivated to materialize models (and the  respective model tables) in order to benefit from the data compression that models enable. This can be achieved by adding the MATERIALIZED keyword in the view definition as shown above.

Note, that the administrator has in general to choose in general between multiple model generators, which come with different compression levels and corresponding guarantees regarding information preservation. Indeed, a major research issue, discussed in Section~\ref{sec:model-generators}, is the semiautomation of the choice of model generators, which should take into consideration the query/analytics workload.

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\begin{example}
In a modification of the running example, the administrator can choose to capture temperature in a single model \texttt{full\_model} that predicts the temperature based on \texttt{x}, \texttt{y} and \texttt{t} and is defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW full_model AS 
arma(SELECT X, Y, T, Temp
FROM temp_meas, temp_sensor WHERE Sensor = ID; X, Y, T; Temp)
\end{verbatim}

The reasons for doing so could be: (a) The individual sensor models may be heavily correlated based on the \texttt{X} and \texttt{Y} sensor coordinates. In such case, a single model can have a much more compact representation than the collection of individual sensor models.
(b) The analytics may need temperature predictions for specific locations, which do not coincide with any individual sensor.
\end{example}
\vspace*{0.5cm}

%\paragraph{Vector quantities} In the general case, a model's quantity is a vector (rather than a scalar) from the domain $\mathcal{\bar{Q}}$.

\paragraph{Probabilistic model tables} In the general case a model returns probability distributions of the quantities, rather than absolute values. Therefore a model is a function $f:\mathcal{\bar{D}}\mapsto \mathcal{H_{\bar{Q}}}$, where $\mathcal{H_{\bar{Q}}}$ is the space of probability distributions over the quantity domain $\mathcal{\bar{Q}}$. The probability distributions capture the certainty of the predicted values.  For example, the model of Example~\ref{xmpl:models-and-definitions} can easily benefit from returning probability distributions of the predicted temperatures. A key use case is that the probability distributions indicate how certain one is about the confidence intervals of the predicted quantities.

%\paragraph{Viewing models as infinitely-sized tables} Notice that a model $f:\mathcal{\bar{D}}\mapsto \mathcal{H_{\bar{Q}}}$ can be also perceived as a table $R_f(\bar{D}, \bar{Q}, H)$, where the table has an infinite number of tuples, the coordinates $\bar{D}$ form a key and the attribute $H$ provides the value of the probability distribution at the specific coordinates.
%Correspondingly, the models that are the values of a table's attribute can be perceived as infinite size nested tables.%

%\paragraph{Model representations} 
%Models are associated with {\em representations}, which contain the data needed to compute the functions. For example, the representation of a model generated by Fourier analysis will consist of the significant frequencies present in the signal, possibly along with data that modulate the noise. 

\subsection{Queries and Optimized Query Evaluation}
\label{sec:queries}
A key success factor of database systems has been the declarative SQL query language where the user/developer expresses the desired result of his analysis without having to specify the algorithm that computes this result and without having to refer to the data structures where the data are stored. The database discovers the optimal plan to compute the result, making best use of the available data structures. 

In the spirit of declarative programming, Plato offers two categories of SQL extensions that enable model-related computations, while Plato utilizes model-specific rewritings to optimize the computation. 

Unlike conventional query optimization, where the rewritings produce equivalent expressions, opportune rewritings in model-based databases are not guaranteed to produce queries with identical results. Rather, in many important cases the results are guaranteed to be equivalent under common assumptions of statistical signal processing. In other cases, they are guaranteed to be equivalent within certain error bounds. Plato queries allow the user to specify the requested guarantee by providing appropriate parameters.

The first category utilizes various functions that input models and output statistic measures or models. The second category allows variables that range over the infinitely-many coordinate points.
