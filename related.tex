\paragraph{Works from ML and statistical signal processing communities} \reminder{for Yoav}

\paragraph{MauveDB} Argued for the value of direct SQL processing. MauveDB uses models to predict values on a developer-specified grid. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Plato argues that models need no be discretized in the coordinates' grid. A fully virtual approach, where the model is perceived as a continous function, is easier for the developer and more opportune for the optimizer. For example, consider two models represented by their Fourier transform and a query that asks for their correlation. It is most efficient to compute directly on the frequency domain rather than bringing back to time domain.
%
\item Did not investigate the connections between (a) choosing models and query workload and (b) query guarantees given chosen models.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Function Db (MIT)} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Showed that in the case of models captured by polynomials better compression and faster processing is achieved by working directly on polynomials.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Aberer}
\reminder{for Yannis K: It seems he promised a lot and did a little. What do we write about this?}


\paragraph{Approximate query processing}
