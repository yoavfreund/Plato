\section{Broad Impact}
\label{sec:broad-impact}

This proposal is part of a broad UCSD initiative in big data
analytics. One of the components of this effort is a new graduate
degree titled ``master of advanced studies in data science and
engineering'' or MAS-DSE for short. The graduate program is targeted
at continuing education for students that are currently working in
industry and whose goal is to become data scientists. The target
audience, defined after extensive market research, will consist of
people with batchelor degrees in computer science or statistics or
people with a degree in the physical sciences that have extensive
experience in scientific data analysis. The MAS-DSE course plan
combines courses in Statistics, Data management and visualization and
the scientific method culminating with a capstone project in which
teams will analyze a large data set.

Co-PI Freund directs the program and both he and PI Papakonstantinou
teach courses in the MAS-DSE program. The plato system will be an
invaluable framework for MAS-DSE as it brings together declarative
data queries and statistical modeling.
