\section{Motivation}

The analysis of sensor data has traditionally been the domain of
signal processing, image processing, audio processing and the
like. However, these experts are challanged when data is
collected from large ad-hoc sensor networks. In such a situation it is
nor enough to replicate the single sensor solution for each
sensor. Instead, an integrated system that provides real-time signal
processing, data flow management and data integration is needed. This
need naturally leads us to database systems.

However, existing database systems are not a good solution, for
several reasons.
\begin{itemize}
\item Database systems use schemas which provide a high-level
  representation of the structure of the data. We call this type of
  organization explicit or extrinsic. The extrinsic structure of the
  data collected in a sensor is very simple - it is a collection of
  sample sequences which can sometime be represented as a single table
  with measurements as the columns and sample times as the rows.
\end{itemize}
